%      usage: mlrLoadLastView()
%         by: justin gardner
%       date: 04/02/15
%    purpose: This function became necessary since in version 8.2, mathworks 
%             inexplicably busted figure handles. Now they are handles and
%             if you load an old variable with a handle, it causes massive
%             convulsions in matlab. It also tries to pop up a figure - which
%             is not what we want - eeks. Anyway, the solution is to load
%             part of the mrLastView variable (viewSettings) and check
%             its version - if it is an old style version then warn the user
%             that we can't load
%
function [v, viewSettings]  = mlrLoadLastView(filename)

v = [];
viewSettings = [];

  help mlrLoadLastView

  mrWarnDlg('(mlrLoadLastView) Could not find %s',filename);
  return

% new version of matlab needs to check if we are trying to load an old file
if ~verLessThan('matlab','8.1')
  if verLessThan('matlab','8.4') % for versions before 8.5, if mrLastView.mat has previously been saved with version >=8.5,
    % loading it issues a lot of warnings (even loading just viewSettings when it contains panel handles)
    % but everything seems to be loading fine, so disabling warnings
    warning('off','MATLAB:class:mustReturnObject'); 
  end
  % load the viewSettings part and look to see if it is a new file
  check = load(filename,'viewSettings');
  if isfield(check,'viewSettings') && isfield(check.viewSettings,'version') && (check.viewSettings.version>=2.0)
    % then we are ok, load the view part
    l = load(filename,'view');

    if verLessThan('matlab','8.4')
      % it can load, but will give lots of warnings, so tell user what is going on

      %JB: in fact I think the warnings appear only if mrLastView has been saved 
      % with matlab >=8.5 and is now being loaded with version <8.5. I already turned
      % them off above because warnings are issued also when loading only viewSettings

      mrWarnDlg(sprintf('(mlrLoadLastView) The mrLastView found: %s is from an older version of matlab which allowed saving figure handles. The geniuses at Mathworks have busted that, so loading this file will no longer work. Moving mrLastView.mat to mrLastView.mat.old You will lose any rois that were loaded but not saved and mrLoadRet will start up without bases and analyses loaded. If you really need what was in the viewer we suggest running on an earlier version of matlab - you just then need to copy mrLastView.mat.old back to mrLastView.mat, open mrLoadRet and then quit - this will save the file back w/out the offending figure handles. Once this is done, you should be able to run the newer version of matlab with the new mrLastView.',filename),'Yes');
