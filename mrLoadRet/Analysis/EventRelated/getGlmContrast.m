%    purpose: function to get r2 image for given combinations of
%             explanatory variables by removing the contribution 
%             of other explanatory variables and then finding the
%             correlation between the residual data and the ortho-
%             goalized combinations (contrasts) 
%       e.g.: d = getr2(d, [1 0 0 0 0])
%             d needs to have a stimulus convolution matrix
%             in d.scm, and contrast must have the same number
%             of columns as d.scm
