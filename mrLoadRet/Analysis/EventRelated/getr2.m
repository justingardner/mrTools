%    purpose: function to get r2 image by
%             finding hdr for each voxel
%             and seeing how much of the
%             variance the estimate accounts for.
%       e.g.: d = getr2(d)
%             d needs to have a stimulus convolution matrix
%             in d.scm
%
function d = getr2(d,verbose)

  precalcmatrix = inverseCovarianceMatrix*d.scm';
  diagOfInverseCovariance = diag(inverseCovarianceMatrix);
% otherwise use pinv
else
  % note that if we need to use the pseudo inverse it means that there is ambiguity in the design
  % such that there are an infinite number of possible solutions. The psuedo-inverse solution
  % chosses the solution with the minimum length (i.e. Euclidian norm)

  % get the diagonal of the inverse of the design covariance matrix (used for estimating standard errors)
